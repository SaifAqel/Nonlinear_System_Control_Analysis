# Nonlinear System Control Analysis

A comprehensive nonlinear control engineering analysis and controller design of a second-order mechanical system, conducted as coursework for the Department of Mechatronics, Optics & Mechanical Informatics.

## Overview

This project involves the modeling, linearization, system analysis, and PID controller design of a nonlinear mechanical system consisting of rotating masses connected via spring and damper elements. Both time-domain and frequency-domain analyses are carried out, including Laplace transforms and Bode plots.
